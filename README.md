This is a simple keylogger program done in Python. This program is simply for educational purposes and should not be used for any malicious act.

The program works by logging all keyboard inputs on a separate text file called "keyLog.txt"

The _pynput_ package is needed for this keylogger to work. To install the package, input this line of code to your Windows command prompt
```py -m pip install pynput```

To exit the keylogger, simply terminate the running terminal.
